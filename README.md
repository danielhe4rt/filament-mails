## Nice to meet you, we're [Backstage](https://Backstage.nl)

Hi! We are a web development agency from Nijmegen in the Netherlands and we use Laravel for everything: advanced websites with a lot of bells and whistles and large web applications.

## About the package

Filament Mails can collect everything you might want to track about the mails that has been sent by your Filament app. Common use cases are provided in this package:

-   Log all sent emails with only specific attributes
-   View all sent emails in the browser using the viewer
-   Collect feedback about the delivery from email providers using webhooks
-   Get automatically notified when email bounces
-   Prune logging of emails periodically
-   Resend logged email to same or another recipient

## Upcoming features

-   We're currently in the process of writing mail events support for other popular email service providers like Resend, SendGrid, Amazon SES and Mailtrap.
-   Relate emails being send in Laravel directly to Eloquent models, for example the order confirmation email attached to an Order model.

## Why this package

Email as a protocol is very error prone. Succesfull email delivery is not guaranteed in any way, so it is best to monitor your email sending realtime. Using external services like Postmark, Mailgun or Resend email gets better by offering things like logging and delivery feedback, but it still needs your attention and can fail silently but horendously. Therefore we created Laravel Mails that fills in all the gaps.

The package is built on top of [Laravel Mails](https://github.com/Backstage/laravel-mails).

## Installation

You can install the package via composer:

```bash
composer require Backstage/filament-mails
```

You can publish and run the migrations with:

```bash
php artisan vendor:publish --tag="mails-migrations"
php artisan migrate
```

You can publish the config file with:

```bash
php artisan vendor:publish --tag="mails-config"
php artisan vendor:publish --tag="filament-mails-config"
```

Optionally, you can publish the views using

```bash
php artisan vendor:publish --tag="filament-mails-views"
```

Add the routes to the PanelProvider using the `routes()` method, like this:

```php
use Backstage\FilamentMails\Facades\FilamentMails;

public function panel(Panel $panel): Panel
{
    return $panel
        ->routes(fn () => FilamentMails::routes());
}
```

Then add the plugin to your `PanelProvider`

```php
use Backstage\FilamentMails\FilamentMailsPlugin;

public function panel(Panel $panel): Panel
{
    return $panel
        ->plugin(FilamentMailsPlugin::make());
}
```

### Tenant middleware and route protection

If you want to protect the mail routes with your (tenant) middleware, you can do so by adding the routes to the `tenantRoutes`:

```php
use Backstage\FilamentMails\FilamentMailsPlugin;
use Backstage\FilamentMails\Facades\FilamentMails;

public function panel(Panel $panel): Panel
{
    return $panel
        ->plugin(FilamentMailsPlugin::make())
        ->tenantRoutes(fn() => FilamentMails::routes());
}
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> For setting up the webhooks to register mail events, please look into the README of [Laravel Mails](https://github.com/Backstage/laravel-mails), the underlying package that powers this package.

### Configuration

Sometimes you want to customize the resource, like configuring which users or roles may access the resource. You can do this by overriding the `MailResource` or `EventResource` classes in the `filament-mails` config file. Make sure your custom resource extends the original resource.

```php
return [
    'resources' => [
        'mail' => \App\Filament\Resources\MailResource::class,
        'event' => \App\Filament\Resources\EventResource::class,
        'suppression' => \App\Filament\Resources\SuppressionResource::class
    ],
];
```
